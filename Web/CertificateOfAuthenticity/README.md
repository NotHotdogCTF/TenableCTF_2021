In this challenge we are once again given the link to the same webpage

The title of this challenge hints at ssl certificates

We can view this in chrome by appending https:// to the ip

We can then view the ssl certificate in the security tab of the inspect element window

We can see that the issued to and issued by fields contain our flag

flag{selfsignedcert}
