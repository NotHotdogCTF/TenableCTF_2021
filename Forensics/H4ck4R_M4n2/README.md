This challenge also related to the pcapng file from part 1

There were two other files transferred over FTP

One was a 7z archive and the other was a text file

If we check out the text file we can see that it says "the password for the compressed file is bbqsauce"

So, we can now download the 7zip file from the raw data in the captured packets and use this password to open the directory

Inside we see a picture with the flag... another rick and morty reference.. nice (again)!

flag{pickl3_NIIICK}
