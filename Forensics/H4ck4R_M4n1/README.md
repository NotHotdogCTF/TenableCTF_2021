For this challenge we are given a pcapng file

We can open this in wireshark to analyze it

In this file we can see that there are some files passed over ftp

We can save the raw data of these files as their file type and try to open them

If we save butter.jpg as a jpg and open it we can get our flag.. a Rick and Morty reference.. nice!

flag{u_p4ss_butt3r}
