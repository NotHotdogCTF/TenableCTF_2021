In this challenge we are given a very long cipher text

We can run this through an analysis program and find that it is a vignere cipher

We can use a similar program to try to determine what the key might be

From this we can see that the key is "Anonymous"

Decoding it with this key will yield our flag in the text

flag{classicvigenere}
