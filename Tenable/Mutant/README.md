For the Tenable challenges we were given a Nessus DB file to examine and try to find the four flags hidden within

To find the Mutant flag we needed to export the db file to xml

This is an option in Nessus Essentials (the free version of Tenable's tool)

From there we can skim through the file and find our flag

flag{1t's eXt3n51bl3}
